Open-source toolkit for **h402 — the x402 router for agent capabilities**. One endpoint per task: h402 routes each call to the best API provider and settles per call in Base USDC over x402.

> x402 is the rail. h402 is the router.

- **Browse capabilities** → https://h402.hunt.town/catalog
- **Docs & agent quickstart** → https://h402.hunt.town/docs
- **AI agents** → point yours at [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md): it can create a wallet, fund it with Base USDC, and start calling tools with no per-provider keys.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`@h402/core`](./packages/core) | Dependency-light TypeScript protocol toolkit: x402 types, header codecs, and the EIP-3009 typed-data builder. Signer-agnostic. |
| [`@h402/cli`](./packages/cli) | Local, non-custodial CLI: manage a wallet, browse the catalog, quote, and pay-per-call against an h402 backend. |

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install -g @h402/cli

# A local, non-custodial wallet (keys stay on your machine; passphrase-less by default):
h402 wallet create --name agent
# Fund it with a few dollars of Base USDC — send to the printed address.
# h402 wallet fund --name agent prints the address and funding instructions.

h402 search "web search"
h402 call web/search --name agent --json '{"query":"agent payments"}'
```

The CLI targets the production backend (`https://h402.hunt.town`) by default; set `H402_API_URL` or `--api-url` only when pointing at another backend such as local dev.

The CLI signs locally through [Open Wallet Standard](https://github.com/open-wallet-standard) core, so a global install is self-contained on supported platforms — no separate wallet install needed.

OWS native bindings currently target macOS/Linux glibc on x64/arm64. Non-wallet commands (`--help`, `search`, `quote`) lazy-load OWS and still work without native bindings; wallet creation and payment signing require those JS native bindings.

## How it works

You call a task (`category/action`); the proxy answers with an x402 `402 PAYMENT-REQUIRED`; the CLI signs a Base USDC EIP-3009 authorization locally and retries — you pay the exact per-call price and get a canonical JSON response. Pass `--max-usd <amount>` (or store a string `maxUsd`, such as `"0.05"`, in `~/.h402/config.json`) to refuse signing a challenge above that USDC cap; paid call output includes `h402.signedAmount`. Keys never leave your machine.

A successful `call` prints `{ "data": <provider result>, "meta"?: <contract metadata>, "h402": <routing metadata> }`: the upstream provider's JSON is under `data`; route-level normalized metadata may appear under `meta`; and `h402` carries `routeId`, `provider`, `selectedCandidateId`, `routing`, `paidBy`, `ledgerEntryId`, optional `paymentTransaction`, optional `followUp` instructions, and, for paid x402 calls, `signedAmount`. Do not discard `meta` — it is part of the route contract when present. On failure the CLI exits non-zero and writes `{ "error": { "message", "detail"? } }` to stderr — `message` is a human-readable diagnostic, and `detail` carries the backend's JSON error when the request reached the backend.

Async routes may return a job receipt instead of the final result. When `h402.followUp` is present, follow its `method`, `path`, `params.jobId`, `docsUrl`, and `instruction` (or the route's `*-status` capability) until the job completes. The follow-up path is provider-bound, so preserve the provider segment from that path when translating the instruction to CLI form. Match `followUp.method` — GET params go via `--query`, POST bodies via `--json`; the CLI rejects `--query` on a POST (`<followUp.params>` means its JSON-encoded object):

```bash
# followUp.method GET (most status polls):
h402 call <followUp.routeId> \
  --provider <provider-from-followUp.path> \
  --query '<followUp.params>'

# followUp.method POST (e.g. ai/music-status-async):
h402 call <followUp.routeId> \
  --provider <provider-from-followUp.path> \
  --json '<followUp.params>'
```

Auto routing capability-routes provider-native input to an enabled candidate whose strict schema accepts it. `web/search` accepts common fields such as `query` and `limit` on the default `auto` route, and capable candidates can also accept native fields such as `freshness` without a pin. Use `--provider` only for determinism, deliberate provider selection, or provider-bound follow-ups.

## Development

```bash
npm install        # install all workspaces
npm run build      # build every package
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit across packages
npm run lint       # eslint across packages
npm test           # vitest across packages
```

Node 22+. ESM throughout.

## Releasing

**Publish `@h402/core` before `@h402/cli`.** `@h402/cli` depends on `@h402/core` as a registry dependency, so core must be available on npm first or a clean `npm install -g @h402/cli` will fail to resolve it.

Before publishing, verify and smoke-test the packed artifacts:

```bash
npm run verify:pack   # each tarball ships its compiled dist
npm run smoke:pack    # pack core+cli, install both into a clean project, run `h402 --help`
```

Each package's `prepack` builds `dist` automatically on `npm pack` / `npm publish`; `verify:pack` asserts the tarball contents so a clean checkout can never publish a package without its JS/types. `smoke:pack` goes further — it installs the packed core + cli into a throwaway prefix and runs `h402 --help`, catching install/entrypoint breakage (an unresolvable `@h402/core`, a broken bin) that an in-repo build would hide. (It runs only `--help`, so it does not cover OWS-binary resolution.) Both run in CI.
